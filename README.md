# FoodDelivery

## I have used the Nearest Neighbor heuristics algorithm (STSP) to solve the question.
### Assuming travelling from location A to location B is the same as the trip from B to A. 
### * My thumb rule is going to the nearest location on the trip will give me a better travel time.
### * Starting from the delivery boy and traversing to the next restaurant to pick up an order.
### * And decide what is better, to go to another restaurant or deliver the orders he/she has picked up.
### * And the above step until he/she has travelled to all the locations.

## I have also added a test case.
