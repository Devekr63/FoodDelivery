# FoodDelivery

## I have used the Nearest Neighbor heuristics algorithm to solve the question.
### I am assuming going to the nearest location on the trip will give me a better travel time.
### Starting from the delivery boy and traversing to the next restaurant to pick up an order,
### and decide what is optimum for going to another restaurant or delivering the orders he/she has picked up.

## I have also added a test case.
